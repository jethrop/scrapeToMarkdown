We're now 7 months into building Supabase. This update is a big one!

### Quick demo#

Watch a full demo:

### Third-party logins#

We've released OAuth logins! You can now enable third-party logins on your app
for Bitbucket, GitHub, GitLab, or Google.

### Clone tables#

You can duplicate your tables, just like you would inside a spreadsheet.

### Enable and disable extensions#

Extensions are easier to use. You can enable Postgres extensions with the
click of a button.

### Save your favorite queries#

The SQL editor now stores your query history in your browser. You can also
save your favorite queries to run later!

### GitHub Discussions#

Supabase was given access to [GitHub
Discussions](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/discussions)! This is the
place for you to ask questions or show off what you've built with Supabase.

### Kaizen#

  * Our dashboard now uses [Next.js automatic static optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/automatic-static-optimization) \- so it should be noticeably more responsive.
  * We created an Isomorphic [`gotrue-js`](https://github.com/supabase/gotrue-js/) TypeScript library for interacting with Netlify's [GoTrue server](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue). This will soon be bundled into `supabase-js`
  * We migrated our [`postgrest-js`](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-js/) library to TypeScript, and it will soon be bundled into `supabase-js`

### From the community#

  * @kiwicopple [appeared on GitHub's Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/github/video/751281550) for Open Source Friday with @MishManners
  * @kiwicopple [discussed pricing for Open Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLhI6cccBQA) with GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij
  * @Thorwebdev [presented Supabase Auth at the SingaporeJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUMxJ4w-MUU) meetup
  * [realtime-py](https://github.com/lionellloh/realtime-py) is underway thanks to [@lionellloh](https://github.com/lionellloh) & [@j0](https://github.com/j0)
  * [postgrest-dart](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-dart) was shipped by [@phamhieu](https://github.com/phamhieu)
  * [postgrest-csharp](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-csharp) is being implemented by [@acupofjose](https://github.com/acupofjose)

### Hacktoberfest#

There's been [plenty of
drama](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/hacktoberfest-update) during
Hacktoberfest, but Supabase is committed to helping new contributors get
started with open source. We've already seen a lot of issues closed by new
members to our community and first-time contributors. If you're looking for
ways to get involved, read our Hacktoberfest [blog post](/blog/supabase-
hacktoberfest-2020), check our [live
stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_xRLTjvEiE&t=60s), and then dive into
our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/projects/5).

### Coming next#

Our focus now is to move from Alpha to Beta and we'll be improving stability,
reliability, and performance. We've created a
[Benchmarks](https://github.com/supabase/benchmarks/) repository, where we'll
be measuring the performance of all the open source tools we use.
