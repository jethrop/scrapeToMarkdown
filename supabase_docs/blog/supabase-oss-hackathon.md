[To celebrate the Supabase Special Announcement on April
15th](https://supabase.com/special-announcement) we're running a special 10
day open source hackathon.

The hackathon starts right now! (Friday 12th April at 09:00 am PT) and ends
Sunday 21st April at 11:59 pm PT. You could win a set of Apple AirPods along
with extremely limited edition Supabase swag and add your name to the Supabase
Hackathon Hall of Fame.

For some inspiration check out all the [winners from previous
hackathons](https://supabase.com/blog/tags/hackathon).

This is the perfect excuse to "Build in a weekend, scale to millions". Since
you retain all the rights to your submissions, you can use the hackathon as a
launch pad for your new Startup ideas, side-project, or indie hack.
