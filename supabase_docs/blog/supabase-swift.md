We are excited to announce that Supabase Swift libraries are now officially
supported by Supabase.

This makes it simple to interact with Supabase from applications on Apple's
platforms, including iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS:

`  

_13

let url = URL(string: "...")!

_13

let anonKey = "public-anon-key"

_13

let client = SupabaseClient(supabaseURL: url, supabaseKey: anonKey)

_13

_13

struct Country: Decodable {

_13

let id: Int

_13

let name: String

_13

}

_13

_13

let countries: [Country] = try await supabase.from("countries")

_13

.select()

_13

.execute()

_13

.value

  
`
