Today we're launching a new [GitHub Copilot extension for VS
Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Supabase.vscode-
supabase-extension) to make your development with Supabase and VS Code even
more delightful, starting with a Copilot-guided experience for [database
migrations](/docs/guides/cli/local-development#database-migrations).

The foundation for this extension was created by [Anas
Araid](https://github.com/anas-araid) during a previous [Launch Week
Hackathon](https://twitter.com/anas_araid/status/1736641409094988033).
Impressed with their work, we partnered with them to add a ["Chat
Participant"](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/chat), an
exciting [new feature recently
launched](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2024/06/24/extensions-are-all-
you-need) by the GitHub and VS Code teams at Microsoft.

## Features#

The VS Code extension is quite feature rich:

### GitHub Copilot Chat Participant#

The extension provides a [Chat
Participant](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/chat) for
GitHub Copilot to help with your Supabase questions. Simply type `@supabase`
in your Copilot Chat and the extension will include your database schema as
context to Copilot.

### Copilot-guided database migrations#

The extension provides a guided experience to create and apply [database
migrations](/docs/guides/cli/local-development#database-migrations). Simply
type `@supabase /migration <describe what you want to do>` in your Copilot
Chat and the extension will generate a new SQL migration for you.

### Inspect tables & views#

Inspect your tables and views, including their columns, types, and data,
directly from the editor:

### List database migrations#

See the migration history of your database:

### Inspect database functions#

Inspect your database functions and their SQL definitions:

### List Storage buckets#

List the Storage buckets in your Supabase project.

## What's Next?#

We're excited to continue adding more features that will make your development
experience with Supabase even more delightful - and for this we need your
help! If you have any feedback, feature requests, or bug reports, please [open
an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-vscode-
extension/issues).

The extension requires you to have the Supabase CLI installed and have your
project running locally. In a future release, we will integrate the [Supabase
Managamenet API](/docs/reference/api/introduction) into the extension to make
connecting to your hosted Supabase projects as seamless as possible.

## Contributing to Supabase#

The entire Supabase stack is [fully open source](/open-source), including
[this extension](https://github.com/supabase-community/supabase-vscode-
extension). In fact, this extension was originally created by [Anas
Araid](https://github.com/anas-araid) during a [previous Launch Week
Hackathon](https://twitter.com/anas_araid/status/1736641409094988033).

Your contributions, feedback, and engagement in the Supabase community are
invaluable, and play a significant role in shaping our future. Thank you for
your support!
