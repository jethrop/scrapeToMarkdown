We're now 4 months into building [Supabase](/), which means another major
update. Here's a few things we think you'll love in this release.

### 4 minute demo#

Watch a full demo:

### View relational data#

We're sometimes asked how we will make Postgres as simple as Firebase, since
Postgres is a relational database. This month we're making our first steps to
prove that relational databases can be even easier to use than document
stores. We're releasing an excel-like editing interface which can drill down
into your relational data.

### Manage JSON data#

Postgres is an amazing database, giving the flexibility of a document store
with the power of a RDBMS. If you use `JSON` data in Postgres, then we want to
make that easy too. Supabase detects when your column is `JSON` or `JSONB`,
and provides an easy way to edit and view your data. More improvements coming
soon for this feature!

### Choose your region#

If you noticed a bit of latency on Supabase, it's because your projects were
previously set up in Singapore. It was always our intention that you'd be able
to choose your database region, and this month we've delivered it. In the next
releases we'll even allow you to go multi-region, instantly replicating your
database close to your customers.

### Backups#

A guiding principle at Supabase is zero lock-in. So this month we are exposing
your daily database backups on the dashboard, giving you a simple way to
migrate off Supabase. We have a lot more to build in this space (`WAL-G!`), so
watch this space.

### Kaizen#

We have a number of small improvements:

  * Improved SQL editor - with better syntax highlighting
  * Improved API docs - with more code snippets
  * UX improvements - with a simplified and consistent UX

### Hiring#

  * This month we [welcome Steve Chavez to the team](/blog/supabase-steve-chavez). Steve is a maintainer of PostgREST, one of the core tools which makes Supabase possible.
  * We're hiring a part-time designer or UX expert. See more [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23708351).
