We're 6 months into building our hosted database platform and we've made some
major improvements to our auth system and table view.

### Quick Demo#

Watch a full demo:

### Easily create tables#

Set up tables and columns directly from the table view.

### Invite your team#

You can now invite team members to your organisation.

### Auth: Email Confirmations#

You can now enable Email Confirmations for new users. This can be toggled on
or off and the template for this email can be edited via the dashboard.

### TypeScript support#

The biggest communty contribution to date,
[@thorwebdev](https://twitter.com/thorwebdev) added TypeScript support to
Supabase. He even [live streamed the
process](https://twitter.com/thorwebdev/status/1292722189788016641).

### Kaizen#

We have a number of small improvements:

  * supabase-js now has [UMD support](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/pull/156)
  * We significantly [improved our docs](/docs). Try out the new search!
  * All of our awesome sponsors are now listed [on our OSS page](/open-source).

### From the community#

The release of Auth last month accelerated our community growth, based on
[Orbit Levels.](https://github.com/orbit-love/orbit-model)

  * We received our first enterprise sponsor. Thanks to [@briannekimmel](https://twitter.com/briannekimmel) from [@WorkLifeVC](https://twitter.com/WorkLifeVC) for becoming an [Enterprise Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/supabase).
  * [@amorriscode](https://github.com/amorriscode) added Redwood support! [[Pull Request](https://github.com/redwoodjs/redwood/pull/1033)]
  * [@swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx) trying out Supabase with Color Search Engine with Supabase [[Live Stream](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1300538001508896768)]
  * Python Support: [@lqmanh](https://github.com/lqmanh) has agreed to lead the python support. He's already deployed [postgrest-py](https://github.com/supabase/postgrest-py) which is the first step towards a functioning supabase-py client lib.
  * [@phamhieu](https://github.com/phamhieu) built a [Live Map Tracker](https://github.com/phamhieu/supabase-realtime-map) App using Supabase + Leafletjs

### Coming next#

Our focus now is to move from Alpha to Beta. This involves stabilising our
Auth API, improving dashboard performance, and benchmarking all of our
systems. This could take more than one month, as we have a number of company-
related activities to wrap up ([we just finished
YC](https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/25/here-are-the-94-companies-from-y-
combinators-summer-2020-demo-day-2/)!).
