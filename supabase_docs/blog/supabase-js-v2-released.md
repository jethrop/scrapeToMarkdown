During our [last Launch Week](/launch-week) we presented the [release
candidate for supabase-js v2](/blog/supabase-js-v2). Since then we've been
busy incorporating your feedback, [updating the
docs](/docs/reference/javascript/),
[examples](https://github.com/supabase/supabase/tree/master/examples),
[quickstart guides](/docs/guides/with-nextjs), and putting a [migration
guide](/docs/reference/javascript/v1/upgrade-guide) together.

## What is new in v2?#

Enhanced TypeScript support built right in was the big one! Now you can use
the CLI to generate types, directly from your database.

Plus v2 comes with lots of improvements that solved some of the largest pain-
points highlighted by our users. Your feedback help us improve: you speak, we
listen.

Read all the updates and the differences with v1 on the [announcement blog
post](/blog/supabase-js-v2)

## Acknowledgements#

It truly takes a village, well, in this case an entire community, and we want
to thank you all for your feedback, and contributions!

Version 2.0 is the result of the combined work of several Supatroopers
(Alaister, Andrew, Inian, Joel, Jon, Kang, Bobbie, and Tyler), over 100
contributors to our libraries, and over 450 contributors to our docs and
websites.
