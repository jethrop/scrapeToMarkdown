This month we welcome [Steve Chavez](https://github.com/steve-chavez) to the
team. Steve is a maintainer of PostgREST, one of the core tools which makes
Supabase possible.

Steve and I have been in contact since he [added one of my old blog
posts](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest-
docs/commit/3dde972d31519d3afc319015bce1dc0f73adeb8e#commitcomment-35312841)
to the PostgREST docs. He has a rich history in open source and we're excited
to have him in our team.

Steve is helping us build one of our most demanded features - our Auth system.
We will support him to build some exciting features which he has planned for
PostgREST, including enhanced PostGIS support.
