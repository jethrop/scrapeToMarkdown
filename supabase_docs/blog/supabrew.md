Supabase is best known as being a Developer Experience focused database
company. As we expand our offerings and feature set, itâ€™s only natural that we
expand into other greenfield areas of the Developer Experience stack. After
all, Supabase exists to solve developer problems, wherever we find them.

One thing we noticed ALL developers require when they sit down to code is
refreshment. Thereâ€™s nothing worse than being in the middle of a 4000 line PR
review and experiencing an extreme, unquenchable thirst. After extensive
market review, we discovered that there doesnâ€™t yet exist a product to fill
this gap in the market.

We surveyed our 80,000 registered developers, and asked them if they could
help us design the perfect beverage for coding - what would it be? The result
was a light, refreshing, low sugar, and non-alcoholic beverage.

If youâ€™ve been following our social media recently you will have seen that the
entire team is currently working from a remote location in Bavaria, Germany.
This is no coincidence. We came here primarily to sample beverages from some
of the worldâ€™s oldest and best breweries. And we are proud to announce for the
first time today, our latest solution to Developer Experience problems has
arrived...

### SupaBrew. An all-natural, light and refreshing non-alcoholic beer -
engineered specifically for the needs of devs.#

Brewed in accordance with strict Germany Beer Purity laws, SupaBrew is made
from 3 open source ingredients: Barley, Hops, and Water. With the absence of
preservatives, you can be sure that youâ€™re feeding your brain with only the
purest liquids, which will keep your mind sharp, enabling you to squash bugs
and center divs late into the night, and through to the early hours of the
morning. And itâ€™s not just an evening beverage, we specifically adapted the
taste so you can even enjoy it during your 9am stand ups.

You wonâ€™t have any blockers to report when it comes to sustainability either.
Each bottle is made from recycled CRT monitors, and the labels are made from
Ubuntu stickers leftover from last yearsâ€™ FOSDEM.

By far the best feature of SupaBrew, is the pricing structure. Thanks to an
innovative product-led growth strategy, indie devs can start enjoying SupaBrew
for free. As your consumption increases, you can move onto our Pay-as-you-
Drink plan. And features such as priority delivery, empty bottle collections,
and CopplePack (your order will be hand picked and packed by our Chief Brewing
Officer - [kiwicopple](http://github.com/kiwicopple)) are available as
Enterprise add-ons. Subscription based plans, and pay-per-seat arrangements
are also available for teams of 15 and larger.

This is of course an April Fools, but since you're here why not check out what
