Happy New Year! We concluded 2023 with [Launch Week
X](https://supabase.com/launch-week). Here's a rundown of all the fantastic
goodies we shipped... now, let the building commence!

## Day 1 - Supabase Studio: AI Assistant and User Impersonation#

Supabase Studio received a major update that reflects our commitment to a SQL-
first approach and user-centric development. Awesome features like easy RLS
policies with an AI assistant, Postgres Roles, User Impersonation, and much
more.

Day 2 - Edge Functions: Node and native npm compatibility

Edge Functions now natively supports npm modules and Node built-in APIs. You
can directly import millions of popular, commonly used npm modules into your
Edge Functions.

## Day 3 - Supabase Branching#

A Postgres database for every GitHub branch ü§ù. Database branching means you
can have separate database instances for each feature of your application.

## Day 4 - Supabase Auth: Identity Linking, Hooks, and HaveIBeenPwned
integration#

We announced several new features for Supabase Auth: Identity Linking, Session
Control, Leaked Password Protection, and Auth Hooks with Postgres functions.

## Day 5 - Introducing Read Replicas#

This is a huge one for anyone wanting to serve data closer to the users or
distribute loads across multiple databases. Learn how we implemented Read
Replicas and how to use them in your projects.

## Launch Week X Hackathon Winners#

Going through all 64 projects was cool, the most submissions we've ever had.
Picking a winner was a bit tricky though, the quality was impressive.

In the end, we chose [Supafork](https://github.com/chroxify/supafork) as the
winner of the Best Overall project üëè. Created by
[Christo](https://twitter.com/0xChroxify), SupaFork is inspired by Vercel's
Deploy button and it allows an easier setup for self-hosted apps using
Supabase.
