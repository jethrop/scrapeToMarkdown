# Introduction

Tamagui makes styling React easy and fast on web, Android, and iOS. It focuses
on platform-native output, with an optional optimizing compiler that
significantly improves your app or site performance.

Tamagui is three things:

  * [`@tamagui/core`](/docs/core/introduction) is a style library that expands on the React Native style API with many features from CSS - all without any external dependency except for React.
  * [`@tamagui/static`](/docs/intro/compiler-install) is an optimizing compiler that [significantly improves performance](/docs/intro/benchmarks) by hoisting objects and CSS at build-time, leaving behind flatter React trees.
  * [`tamagui`](/docs/components/stacks) is a large universal component kit in styled and unstyled forms.

#### Quick start

Choose from a few starters:

`npm create tamagui@latest`Copy

#### [InstallSet up an app.](/docs/intro/installation)

#### Highlights

  * Core only has one dependency - React - but supports the full React Native View and Text API, a superset of the React Native Style API, styled(), powerful hooks, and the typed design system helpers in ~28Kb on web.

  * A smart, partial-evaluating compiler gives 0-runtime performance with the ergonomics of writing your code however you want - even inline, logic-filled code is optimized.

  * Every feature works at runtime and compile-time, so none of the usual limits of 0-runtime libraries, while optionally getting the same great performance.

  * useTheme and useMedia hooks with signal-like granularity and dirty tracking.

  * Unstyled and styled versions of all components.
