# Platform-Specific Code

You can use different code on different platforms by specifying different file
extensions.

See the [tree shaking](/recipes/tree-shaking) guide for more.

## Video​

For a video walkthrough of using different code per-platform, see my 2021
Next.js Conf talk at about 21:53:

## Example​

One example of platform-specific code is using `@react-native-firebase` on
Native, and `firebase` on Web.

To see how this works, you can reference the [source
code](https://github.com/nandorojo/nextjs-
conf-22-example/tree/setup/packages/app/features/auth/firebase) from my 2022
Next.js Conf talk. Here's the Firebase section.
