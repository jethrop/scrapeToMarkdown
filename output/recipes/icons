# Icons

When searching for an icon pack, use an SVG-based icon library with proper
tree shaking, not a font-based library.

## Recommendation​

  1. Take a folder (or multiple folders) of SVG icons

  2. For each icon, turn it into a component using `react-native-svg` in its own file.

a. SVGR is a preferred tool for this. You can create a [node
script](https://github.com/nandorojo/react-native-
heroicons/blob/master/generate/index.ts) that handles this for you.

  3. Export each icon as its own module for proper tree shaking.

  4. Install `react-native-svg` (and any library which wraps it) and add them to `transpilePackages` in `next.config.js`. You'll need to rebuild your Expo Dev Client if you aren't using Expo Go.

You can also find many of these libraries on GitHub/NPM. Here are two open
source examples (but there are many others too):

  * [@nandorojo/heroicons](https://github.com/nandorojo/react-native-heroicons)
  * [@nandorojo/iconic](https://github.com/nandorojo/react-native-iconic)

Those repositories have a generator
[script](https://github.com/nandorojo/react-native-
heroicons/blob/master/generate/index.ts) which you can fork to create your own
icon packs. Or, you can install them from NPM.

> If you decide to fork an existing icon repository, please credit and link
> back to it at the top of your Readme.

The usage will look like this:

    
    
    tsx
    
    // ✅ tree-shaken, SVG-based icons
    
    import { Person } from '@nandorojo/heroicons'
    
    const Icon = () => <Person />
    
    Copy
    
    
    tsx
    
    // ✅ tree-shaken, SVG-based icons
    
    import { Person } from '@nandorojo/heroicons'
    
    const Icon = () => <Person />
    
    Copy

This is better than a single entrypoint for icons like the one used by
`@expo/vector-icons`.

### Tamagui​

If you are using Tamagui, you can use any of its SVG-based [icon
packs](https://tamagui.dev/docs/components/lucide-icons/1.0.0#credit) too.
