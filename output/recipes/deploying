# Deploying

Using both Github Actions and the tools provided by companies such as Vercel,
we can deploy both our web app and update our mobile app on each commit.

## Web​

Deploying to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) works out of the box when you link
your project via GitHub.

## Expo​

While Expo doesn't have a GitHub integration like Vercel, they do offer
documentation for setting up deployments via Github Action to publish on each
commit: [Expo Github Actions](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/github-
actions/)

However, Expo's docs don't account for a monorepo structure. By adding in
`working-directory` to the Expo Github action, you can run `eas update` in the
correct directory.

    
    
    .github/workflows/update.yml
    
    - name: Publish update
      run: eas update --auto
      working-directory: ./apps/expo
    
    Copy
    
    
    .github/workflows/update.yml
    
    - name: Publish update
      run: eas update --auto
      working-directory: ./apps/expo
    
    Copy
