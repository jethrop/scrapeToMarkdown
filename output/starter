# Starter Project

To get you up and running instantly, I created a starter monorepo with all the
annoying config done for you.

You can see the monorepo and what comes installed
[here](https://github.com/nandorojo/solito/tree/master/example-
monorepos/blank).

## Start from Vercel​

Click this button and you can instantly deploy the starter project to Vercel
for free. Deploying to Vercel will create a new git repo for you too, so you
don't need to clone it from the terminal.

## Start from the terminal​

You can install the starter monorepo using the CLI if you prefer:

    
    
    sh
    
    npx create-solito-app@latest my-solito-app
    
    Copy
    
    
    sh
    
    npx create-solito-app@latest my-solito-app
    
    Copy
